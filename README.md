# Eulers-Number-in-Dart-Flutter
Dart (Flutter) program to calculate the Euler's Constant number, 'e' .
My custom calculation results in a value close to Euler's Constant without any Math library's assistance . My calculation is accurate up to 8 (eight) digits after the decimal points matching the Euler's Constant 'e' .
